**User Manual: Prometheus-Echo Repository**

**Overall Purpose:**
The Prometheus-Echo repository is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing documentation within software projects. It integrates features for GitHub OAuth authentication, user sign-up/login, JWT token generation, document management, and user manual generation. The repository aims to streamline the development process by offering a consistent and secure environment for handling authentication, document operations, and repository analysis.

**Notable Architecture:**
The repository consists of backend (be) and frontend (fe) directories, each containing distinct functionalities. The backend utilizes Node.js with PostgreSQL for database operations, Express for routing, and TypeScript for type safety. The frontend employs React with TypeScript for building interactive user interfaces, Vite for fast development, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

**How to Set Up and Run:**
1. Clone the repository from the provided source.
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose for containerized development environments.
3. Navigate to the repository root and run `docker-compose up` to start the services.
4. Access the backend and frontend services through the specified ports.
5. Utilize the Devcontainer configurations for isolated development environments.

**Key Functionalities:**
1. **Authentication:** Implement GitHub OAuth authentication for secure user sign-up/login.
2. **Document Management:** Manage documents in a database with JWT authentication, including repository analysis and user manual generation.
3. **Database Operations:** Set up a PostgreSQL connection pool for efficient database interactions.
4. **Frontend UI:** Create visually appealing interfaces for document editing, repository linking, and user navigation.
5. **Error Handling:** Implement error boundaries and error logging for robust application stability.

By following these steps and leveraging the functionalities provided, users can efficiently develop and manage documentation within their software projects using the Prometheus-Echo repository.
